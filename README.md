## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to convince the investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. As per the stakeholders’ request, the following set of visualisations were created:
* Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

These visualizations with an additional two previously created will be added to the final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Results

•	The following two visualisations show the top starting and ending locations for Des Moines. According to the blue and orange indicators, both top starting and ending locations are most frequently seen in the southern areas. It can be assumed that bikes are more popular to use in the south areas.

![Top Ending Locations](https://github.com/nyoung246/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Top%20Ending%20Locations.PNG)

•	As seen below visualisation from the story, it shows that bikes are most frequently used for the duration of around 10 minutes.

•	In the following visualisation, it shows us that more males are using the bikes as opposed to females that use them less frequently.

•	In the visualisation below, it shows us that the bikes are most frequently used during 8 am and 5 to 6pm on weekdays. This can indicate that the bikes are being used as transportation to and from work.

•	The visualization below shows us that males and females show the same pattern of using bikes during 8 am and 5 to 6pm on weekdays, however males are using them more frequently than females.

## Summary

From the visualisations above, we can see that bike sharing is popular in the southern part of Des Moines, more males are utilizing the bikes, and it is assumed that they are using the bikes are a mode of transportation to and from work by analysing the “Trip by Week Per Hour” visualisation. This program can be successful if more bike lanes are implemented in the northern part of Des Moines to capture a wider area of customers, and advertise bike sharing to the female population as there is a large difference between male and female usage.

The below points show two possible visualisations for future analysis:

•	A chart that shows the ratio between male and female for the entire population. From this, we can deduce whether the imbalance of male and female usage is due to the true population ratio.

•	A map with indicators showing bike trails and bike stops. This will give us a picture of why the southern side of Des Moines has a higher bike usage.
